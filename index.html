            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;data centered about new e-health models of care delivery. One such model for health care
was the CHIN, which was a widely sought after model in the late 1990s, and continues
to be widely debated by leading industry groups, such as The Healthy Cities Organization (http://www.healthycities.org) and the IEEE-USA Medical Technology and Policy
Committee (http://www.ieeeusa.org/committees/MTPC).</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While CHINs were said to enable multiple organizations to share health services
data in order to meet common objective(s), ranging from profit maximization to improvement of public health conditions and wellness, health care organizations are now
deploying e-health strategies to accomplish these goals while garnering data to address
community and public health needs. Thus, health care organizations are finding value
as well as strategic applications to mining patient data, in general, and community data,
in particular. While significant gains can be obtained and have been noted at the
organizational level of analysis, much attention has been given to the individual where
the focal points have centered about privacy and security of patient data. While the
privacy debate is a salient issue, data mining offers broader community-based gains that
enable and improve health care forecasting, analyses, and visualization</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the objectives of this chapter are:</p>
            <p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To describe the uses of data-mining techniques in health care;</p>
             <p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To explore the intersection of data mining in the context of CHINs;</p>
             <p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To explain how the CHIN platform can be used for fraud detection, profitability
analysis, patient profiling, and retention management;</p>

                <h1>DATA MINING IN HEALTH CARE</h1>
            </center>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data mining has often been defined as a “process of extracting previously unknown,
valid and actionable information from large databases and then using the information to
make critical business decisions” (Cabena, Hadjinian, Stadler, Verhees, & Zanasi, 1998).
This definition is based on the premise that an organization can link its myriad sources
of data into a data warehouse (to potentially include data marts). Further, these data
sources can evolve to a higher degree of analyses to include exploration using on-line
analytical processing (OLAP), statistical analyses, and querying. One mechanism that
can be used to migrate beyond exploration and permit organizations to engage in
information discovery is the Sample, Explore, Modify, Model and Assess (SEMMA)
Methodology, as developed by the SAS Corporation (http://www.sas.com). In sum,
SEMMA enables its users to: 1) test a segment of data (test data) to be mined for
preliminary outcomes; 2) assess this sample data for outliers, trends, etc.; 3) revise the
sample data set for model testing, which can include neutral networks, linear regression,
and decision trees; 4) evaluate the model for accuracy; and 5) validate the model using
the complete data set (Groth, 1998)</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, the rationale for mining data is a function of organizational needs and
type of firm’s role in the industry. Moreover, researchers (Hirji, 2001; Keim, 2001) have
established that data-mining applications, when implemented effectively, can result in
strategic planning and competitive advantage. In an effort to minimize the collection andstorage of useless and vast amounts of data, mining can identify and monitor which data
are most critical to an organization – thereby providing efficient collection, storage, and
exploration of data (Keim, 2001). The efficiencies associated with mining of “most vital
data” can result in improved business intelligence, heightened awareness of often
overlooked relationships in data, and discovery of patterns and rules among data
elements (Hirji, 2001). Others (http://www.sas.com; Groth, 1998) offer that data mining
permits improved precision when executing

            <p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Retention Management.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, data mining offers the health care industry the capabilities to tackle
imminent challenges germane to its domain. Among them being:</p>
            <p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fraud Detection and Abuse – identification of potential fraud and/or abuse; this
is applicable to insurance claims processing, verification and payment</p>
            <p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Profitability Analysis – determination of categories of profit and loss levels; this
can be practical for analyses of diagnosis related groups (DRGs) and managed care
enrollments</p>
            <p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Patient Profiling – discovery of patients’ health and lifestyle histories as they can
                impact medical coverage and service utilization</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Retention Management – identification of loyal patients and services they use; as
well as those patients that depart from a particular insurance group, community and
profile segment</p>

                <h1>COMMUNITY HEALTH INFORMATION
NETWORKS (CHINS)</h1>
            </center>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the late 1990s and again more recently, CHINs were seen to offer the health
care industry a platform to address and mine medical data to support public and rural
health issues. CHINs have been defined as: “Interorganizational systems (IOSs) using
information technology(ies) and telecommunications to store, transmit, and transform
clinical and financial information. This information can be shared among cooperative and
competitive participants, such as payors, hospitals, alternative delivery systems, clinics,
physicians, and home health agencies” (Brennan, Schneider & Tornquist, 1996; Payton
& Ginzberg, 2001). IOSs have emerged as a primary business model in a number of
industries given the application of wireless, application-integration, Internet, and
broadband technologies. Starting with reservation systems in the airline industry (e.g.,
the SABRE system), IOSs have been used to implement strategic and competitive
advantage in the cotton, hospital supply, consumer goods retailing, and automotive
industries, among others (Clemons & Row, 1993; Copeland & McKenney, 1988). Given
their intended direction for extensive mining of medical data among health care providers,payors, employers, and research institutions, CHINs offer an immediate platform for
patient profiling, fraud detection, profitability analysis, and retention management.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on a voluntary model of organizational participation, CHINs enable member
organizations to share health services data in order to meet common objective(s), ranging
from profit maximization to improvement of public health conditions and wellness.
Further, CHINs can provide a myriad of services from electronic transaction processing
to telephone-based referral information (Brennan et al., 1996). The deployment of CHINs
is confronted with a tremendous number of implementation barriers, largely behavioral
and political in nature. Among the numerous deterrents, as found in Payton and Ginzberg
(2001), were loss of organizational autonomy and control; lack of vendor and patient
support; and lack of understanding of customers’ (patients) needs. Critical to e-health
models, however, are the data quality issues that enable health care providers, researchers, payors, and consumers to make more informed medical decisions.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cooper and Zmud (1990) adopted a diffusion process model of IT implementation
that is based on stages and processes as outlined in Table 1. Cooper and Zmud suggest
that the process model can be used as a framework for understanding how critical
implementation factors evolve over time.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cooper and Zmud (1990) identify five broad contextual factors that might impact the
implementation process: user, organization, task, technology, and environment. Their
description of the implementation process, however, suggests an alternative clustering
of contextual variables. For instance, they state that, in the initiation stage, “pressure
to change evolves from either organizational need (pull) technological innovation (push)</p>
            <h6>Table 1: IT Implementation process model from Cooper and Zmud (1990)</h6>

            <p>or both” (p. 124). In the adoption stage, they describe the processes of “rational and
political” negotiations, and in subsequent stages, they suggest that “technology”
impacts the system implementation. Following this, three factor classes are defined:
push/pull factors, behavioral factors and shared systems topologies. That is, these sets
of factors continue to be important as organizations are pressured to change, examine
opportunities for IOS solutions, obtain organizational backing, develop the IOS applications, and continue to engage in cooperative IOS</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My proposed CHIN implementation model is shown in Figure 1. This implementation model is important to academicians and practitioners, alike – as it holds implications
for data utilization, management, and mining.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Push or pull factors are contextual elements that can impact and influence an
organization’s willingness to participate in IOS initiatives and include perceived competitive advantage (Grover, 1993), competition (Johnston & Vitale, 1988; Copeland &
McKenney, 1988; Grover, 1993), government actions and policies (Linder, 1992; Anderson, Aydin & Jay, 1994), and perceived economic benefits (Mo</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the Push/Pull Factors, I expected both the economic dimensions and
government policies to have a positive impact on the implementation effort. Health care
organizations are currently being pressed toward greater cooperation by government
decisions, policies, and practices (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, Joint Commission on
Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, prospective payment system). Further, the
need to reduce costs while maintaining or increasing quality is a key objective of
numerous managed care models (Ferrat, Lederer, Hall, & Krella, 1996; Grover, 1993;</p>
            <h6>Figure 1: Cooperative CHIN implementation model.

            <img src="Screenshot%202024-01-17%20120843.png" width="1000px" height="500px">
            <p>Kongstvedt, 1989; Little, 1994). Competition among institutions was expected to play
a minor role, given the rise of community models of health care delivery (Brennan et al.,
1996; Payton, Brennan, & Ginzberg, 1995), as health care players learn to cooperate and
collaborate (Ferret et al., 1996) in an effort to overcome the limitations associated with
previously noted economic dimensions.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behavioral factors relate to attributes and actions of key system stakeholders.
These include customer support (in this study, the customer is defined as the patient);
end-user support (Anderson et al., 1994); organizational autonomy and control (Moritz,
1986); physician, application vendor, and top management support (Anderson et al.,
1994; Grover, 1993; Lucas, Ginzberg, & Schultz, 1988). In the case of CHINs, application
vendor support is vital for organizations to gain access to the needed products (Kim &
Michelman, 1990). Another critical behavioral factor is the political dynamics of the
implementation process, which often impacts system endorsement and resource commitment (Aydin & Rice, 1992; Kimberly & Evanisko, 1981).</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Behavioral Factors, quality of CHIN management, vendor support, patient
support, physician support, and end-user support are all expected to have positive
impact on implementation progress. Each of these factors has been shown to foster
change in various intra- and inter-organizational domains (Anderson et al., 1994;
Clemons & Row, 1993; Grover, 1993; Lucas et al., 1990; Whang, 1992), and the same result
should obtain in the CHIN context. Strong autonomy and control of member organizations, however, will tend to inhibit successful CHIN implementation, as organizations
struggle with the tradeoffs of losing some autonomy to the benefits of shared information
(Brockhoff & Teichert, 1995). Political factors, arising from conflicting personal and
organizational objectives among stakeholders, will tend to impede implementation
                progress (Beath, 1991; Linder, 1992).</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shared or integrated systems topologies represent certain aspects of the infrastructure needed for a CHIN. These factors include arrangements for cooperation and
information sharing, as well as for assuring information quality (Clemons & Row, 1993;
Kim & Michelman, 1990; Mason, 1991). These cooperative arrangements for CHINs may
involve physicians, hospitals, third-party payors, laboratories, and pharmacies and will
require an increased degree of electronic information sharing with anticipated improved
information quality (Ernst & Young, 1994; Little, 1994).</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oth elements of Shared System Topologies— information sharing and information quality—were predicted to have favorable impacts on implementation progress.
The prior existence of shared systems would provide foundations for building more
efficient and effective mechanisms for inter-organizational, community-based health
care delivery. As the degree of information sharing among inter-organizational participants increased, the quality of information available was also expected to increase,
thereby fostering successful implementation (Clemons & Row, 1993).</p>
